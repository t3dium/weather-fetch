## How to install

``cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/t3dium/weather-fetch && echo "bash ~/Downloads/weather-fetch/weather-fetch.sh" >> ~/.zshrc && echo "installed and added weather fetch to your terminal startup"``

If you dont use zsh, the 2nd to last command will fail, so change it to ~/.bashrc or whatever shell is used, and re-run the command.

## Todo

- [ ] also implement a basic system fetch (num of packages, resources etc), below the weather fetch
